Code accompanying the paper submitted to Cell Host and Microbe "HPV-induced epigenetic reprogramming of the host genome is lost upon progression to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia" <br>

## Scope and data availability
One dataset generated using Illumina MethlyationEPIC bead chips, previously used for the discovery of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and above was reanalyzed. 
The original raw microarray data is available in the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) database under accession code EGAS00001005078. <br>
A second dataset was generated for this study specifically from an experiment with cancer cell lines where apoptosis was induced using BH3 mimetics. 
The original raw microarray data is available at the NCBI Gene Repository Omnibus (GEO) repository under accession code GSE207224. <br>

The analysis presented in the paper focusses on <br>
1) the genome-wide methylation changes in the host genome upon infection with high-risk HPV <br>
2) devising a classifier predicting HPV status <br>
3) investigating correlations of the HPV classifier with increasing CIN, replicative age and apoptosis.
